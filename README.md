# facialRecognition
This project implements facial recognition using principle component analysis. 

To run facial recognition on the Yale faces database run faceRecEx.m. This script goes through an example displaying intermediary steps of facial recognition. This was made for a presentation on facial recognition in which I explained the various parts.
